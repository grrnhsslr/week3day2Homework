# In VS Code, create a module titled `geometry` and add two functions in there.
# One that will calculate the area of a circle given a radius.
# The second will find the hypotenuse of a right angle given the two sides.
# Import the module or the functions from the module and use it to find the answers to the below questions
import geometry

# What is the area of a circle with a radius of 7cm?
print(geometry.area(7))

# What is the hypotenuse of a right angle with sides of 3in and 4in?
print(geometry.hypotenuse(3, 4))

# 5 inches
